# TicTakToe
This file is intended to add context to the examples in this repository. The sections include:

- **Game Design** - generic notes on designing a Tic Tac Toe game that will be used in each refactor example.
  - [Visual Design](#visual-design)
  - [Game State](#game-state-design)
  - [MVC Pattern](#mvc-pattern)
- **Refactor Examples** - Each of these have dedicated YouTube videos that you can watch to better understand _how_ they were created. Additionally, there are comments throughout the code that attempt to explain important concepts.
  - Vanilla ES6 (see `typescript` branch for a TS implementation)
  - React (see `typescript` branch for a TS implementation)

I have created this tutorial in a _sequential_ fashion. Each example builds on and references previous examples. While examples can be viewed in isolation, the best way to learn is to read through them in order!

## Visual Design

I am not a professional designer, and therefore, I have kept the design refactor to a minimum.

Most of the visual changes were small tweaks to the original or to reflect additional functionality that was added as part of the refactor.
